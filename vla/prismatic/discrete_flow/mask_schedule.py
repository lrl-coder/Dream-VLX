    """Generates a mask rate by scheduling mask functions R.

    Given a ratio in [0, 1), we generate a masking ratio from (0, 1]. During
    training, the input ratio is uniformly sampled; during inference, the input
    ratio is based on the step number divided by the total iteration number: t/T.
    Based on experiements, we find that masking more in training helps.
    Args:
    ratio: The uniformly sampled ratio [0, 1) as input.
    total_unknown: The total number of tokens that can be masked out. For
        example, in MaskGIT, total_unknown = 256 for 256x256 images and 1024 for
        512x512 images.
    method: implemented functions are ["uniform", "cosine", "pow", "log", "exp"]
        "pow2.5" represents x^2.5

    Returns:
    The mask rate (float).
