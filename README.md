Building on the success of Dream 7B, we introduce Dream-VL and Dream-VLA, open VL and VLA models that fully unlock discrete diffusion’s advantages in **long-horizon planning**, **bidirectional reasoning**, and **parallel action generation** for multimodal tasks.

Key Results:
- **Dream-VL**: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among diffusion VLMs, comparable to top-tier AR VLMs trained on open data, with superior performance on visual planning tasks requiring long-horizon reasoning.
- **Dream-VLA**: Establishes top-tier performance with 97.2% average on LIBERO, 71.4% on SimplerEnv–Bridge, and 60.5% on SimplerEnv–Fractal, surpassing leading models including GR00T-N1 and OpenVLA-OFT. Consistently outperforms AR baselines across diverse finetuning objectives.
